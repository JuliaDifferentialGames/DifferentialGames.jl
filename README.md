## Description

This is a work in progress base package for solving various different types of differential games. The goal is to first support the following types of differential game problem types:

- Zero-sum Games
- LQ Games
- Deterministic General Nash Equilibrium Problems
- Stochastic General Nash Equilibrium Problems
- Jump Diffusion General Nash Equilibrium Problems
- Inverse General Nash Equilibrium Problems

Afterwards, the goal is to support:

- Mean field games
- Games with heterogenous players
- Games with learned objective functions
